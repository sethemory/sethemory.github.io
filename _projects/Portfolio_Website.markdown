## Project Overview
<a href="https://github.com/sethemory/sethemory.github.io">Github Repository</a>

In an effort to better showcase my work and skills while also improving and staying practiced, I embarked on creating my own portfolio website using Jekyll, a static site generator that simplifies managing content and layouts. The goal was to create a professional, clean, and user-friendly website that not only highlights my projects but also my journey as a developer.

A primary objective of this project was to establish a polished online presence. In today's tech industry, where a strong digital footprint is crucial for career opportunities and networking, having a well-designed website is essential. This platform effectively showcases my abilities and projects, providing a comprehensive view of my professional accomplishments and technical expertise.The website also aims to improve accessibility to my work. By consolidating my projects, resume, and contact information in one easily navigable location, I sought to make it simpler for potential employers, collaborators, and peers to access and review my work. This streamlined access is designed to facilitate better communication and networking within the tech community.

Moreover, the development of this website serves as a demonstration of my technical skills. The site itself is a testament to my proficiency in web development technologies, including Jekyll, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I have been able to apply and showcase my skills in creating a functional and visually appealing online portfolio.Finally, managing and updating the website provides an ongoing platform for continuous learning. As I work on maintaining and enhancing the site, I continuously improve my skills in web design and development, and content management. This iterative process not only keeps my skills sharp but also ensures that the website evolves alongside my professional growth.

## Key Features and Technologies

### Jekyll and GitHub Pages
To bring my portfolio website to life, I leveraged Jekyll, a powerful static site generator, combined with GitHub Pages for seamless hosting. Jekyll simplifies the process of managing website content and layouts by converting plain text files written in Markdown into a well-structured, static HTML site. Its integration with GitHub Pages provides an efficient way to deploy and host the website without the need for complex server configurations or additional hosting fees.

GitHub Pages allows for direct hosting of Jekyll-generated sites directly from a GitHub repository. By pushing my Jekyll site to a GitHub repository, I benefit from GitHub Pages' robust infrastructure, which ensures reliable performance and automatic updates. This setup not only streamlines the development workflow but also offers built-in version control and collaboration features, making it easier to maintain and update the site as needed. Together, Jekyll and GitHub Pages offer a powerful combination for creating, managing, and hosting a professional and dynamic online portfolio.

### Custom Built Theme
In developing my portfolio website, I designed a custom theme from scratch to ensure it perfectly aligned with my needs and style preferences. The goal was to craft a theme that would seamlessly accommodate diverse sections, including work history, project showcases, and a blog, while also reflecting my personal style. By building the theme from the ground up, I was able to incorporate specific features and layouts tailored to each section, such as a grid-based project display, detailed work history entries, and a clean, readable blog format. This custom approach allowed me to fine-tune every aspect of the site’s appearance, ensuring that it not only met functional requirements but also provided a visually appealing and cohesive experience. The result is a unique and personalized portfolio that effectively showcases my work and skills in a manner that resonates with my individual taste.

The design of the theme was inspired by the nostalgic aesthetics of old terminals. This influence is reflected in the website’s black background, which emulates the classic terminal screen, paired with green and amber text to mimic the traditional color scheme of vintage computer displays. To further enhance this retro feel, a flashing block is incorporated to simulate the appearance of a terminal cursor.

### HTML and CSS
To create a custom theme for my portfolio website, I needed to deeply engage with HTML and CSS. This process involved designing and styling various layouts to ensure they seamlessly integrated with the markdown pages I created with the content that will be displayed on the page. By crafting HTML structures that define how content is organized and styled, I was able to develop a visually coherent and functional theme. CSS played a crucial role in this, allowing me to fine-tune the appearance of these layouts, ensuring that the design not only met my aesthetic preferences but also provided a user-friendly experience. Through this approach, I was able to create a custom, responsive theme that effectively showcases my projects and professional history.
