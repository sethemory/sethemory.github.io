I decided I wanted to pick up archery again. I used to shoot a few years ago and also took a class back in college. I figured it could be something productive I could do in my free time. Today I picked up the bow and went out back to start shooting. In hindsight it probably was not the best day to start this up but it's what I was wanting to do. I say this because it was around 100 on this Saturday. I went out about 15ft and dropped the target on the ground. This first round I was not super concerned about accuracy because I needed to make sure that the bow is sighted in. It hasn't been used in awhile. Even so, the first round was pretty good, other than the one arrow that was different from the rest of the set. I don’t think I will be shooting with that arrow in the future just to keep things consistent. I also wanted to shoot at a target that was just sitting on the ground so I went and got a wooden stool my dad made years ago with some spare wood and strapped it on top. I then shot another round while I was sweating like crazy from the heat and the gnats were swarming me like crazy. At that point accuracy was not a big priority and I just wanted to finish the set. I think next time I am going to try and shoot out front and see if the gnat problem is any better there. After the two sets of shots I decided I was getting too annoyed with the heat and the bugs so I called it a day. Even though I didn’t shoot as much as I wanted, it was a good start.
