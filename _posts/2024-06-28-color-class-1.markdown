One of the classes I took for my Art and Design minor at North Carolina State University was 'Color and Light.' This course offers a unique intersection of art and science, designed for students from diverse disciplines to explore the fundamental concepts of color theory and lighting. Typically housed within the College of Design, it is a vibrant part of the curriculum that attracts students studying art and design, architecture, photography, and even engineering.

The 'Color and Light' class begins with a foundational understanding of colorâ€”its science, perception, and cultural significance. Students learn about the color wheel, color relationships, and the impact of different lighting conditions on the perception of color. The course covers various aspects of color theory, including hue, saturation, and value, and extends into how these elements can be manipulated to achieve desired visual and emotional effects in design and art.

In this post, I will be showcasing the first half of the assignments I created in the class. We explored the primary colors, the secondary colors, and then the tertiary colors that can be created until we had explored the entire color wheel. Once we finished with the color wheel, we began to learn about value, shade, tint, and tone. 'Value' refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. 'Shade' is a dark value added to a color by mixing in black, 'tint' is a light value added by mixing in white, and 'tone' is created by adding gray to a color. The last assignment in this post features a transition between complementary colors in a gradient form, where we gradually added more of the complementary color until they met.
