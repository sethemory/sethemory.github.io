While in school, I had access to a makerspace that had two laser cutting machines. I decided to take the opportunity to learn how to use them and make some pretty cool things.

I racked my brain a bit and tried to think of something interesting I could make with wood. I remembered that cutting boards can be engraved, so I decided to make some for a few people I know. My roommate and I went to Lowe's, and I picked out some wood that I would turn into cutting boards. With my roommate's help, I cut the long piece into two smaller pieces of a good size and then sanded them down. I had already created the designs, so all I needed to do was take them to the laser cutting machines. I had learned how to use them from a project I did for my job, so running them was not a problem, and soon I had my engraved cutting boards. The only thing left was to apply the food-grade finishing oil I got from Amazon. These made great Christmas gifts, and I was really happy to learn something new.

In the next semester, I realized that once I graduated, I probably wouldnâ€™t get the chance to use a laser engraver for a good amount of time afterward. After realizing this, I wanted to make a few more engraved items before graduation. I got my hands on some more wood from which I could get about three small canvas-sized cuts. I decided to make some sort of decoration out of them. After choosing my dad, brother, and sister-in-law as the recipients, I created some designs that I knew they would like. In a similar process, I got these designs engraved and then applied a wood finisher.

These projects were a fun distraction from school and also productive. I was able to pick up some new skills while also creating some cool gifts for my family. I probably should have created something cool for myself.
