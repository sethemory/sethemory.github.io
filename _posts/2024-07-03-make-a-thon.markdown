At the beginning of my last semester at school, I decided to catch up with a friend of mine, Trenton, over some lunch. During that lunch, we talked about many things, but the topic of joining a Make-a-Thon competition came up. The general idea of the competition is that groups of students are given a weekend to 'prototype' some idea aimed at tackling a sustainability issue. We discussed joining as something fun to do together since we were both about to graduate.

When the time came, we signed up and attended the launch event. With just a handful of days, we started brainstorming ideas, exploring various fields where we could address current sustainability challenges, and considering issues on both wide-scale and local levels. We eventually landed on an idea aimed at solving the issue of textile waste—an on-campus thrift store partnered with both Feed The Pack, an on-campus food pantry helping food-insecure students, and the Wilson College of Textiles. The plan was to sell clothing cheaply, donated by school clubs, organizations, and even students or recent graduates who might have excess clothing. Having been involved in a student club and worked in Student Housing, I knew that these groups often acquire branded shirts annually, usually in excess.

The partnership with the campus food bank aimed to tackle multiple issues with one solution. Our research for the project included an interview with one of the pantry managers, and it turned out that food insecurity often boils down to income insecurity. If you can’t afford food, you likely can’t afford much else. We aimed to provide clothing for those experiencing income insecurity, utilizing the donated clothing from those organizations that was just sitting in storage rooms. Additionally, the partnership with the College of Textiles was intended so that any donated clothing could hopefully be salvaged by the students in some way. To prevent waste, we envisioned students possibly creating new garments from old ones or even offering quilting lessons to make use of tattered clothes instead of discarding them.

Once we had the whole concept established, our prototype for the competition was a clothing rack that a customer would see in the store. We found a clothing rack on Facebook Marketplace and sourced all the clothes for the display from people we knew as donations. Since I had experience with the laser cutter and we were focused on sustainability, we created some reusable price tags out of wood and yarn. We prepared our presentation and practiced a bit for the final day. The competition was structured similarly to a science fair, where everyone set up their prototypes and judges walked around, viewing presentations and asking questions.

All in all, Trenton and I didn’t end up winning anything. However, we didn't really care about that; we had a good time working together and were proud of the unique idea we created.
