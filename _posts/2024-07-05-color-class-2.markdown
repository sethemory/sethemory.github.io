One of the classes I took for my Art and Design minor was 'Color and Light' at North Carolina State University. This course offers a unique intersection of art and science, designed for students from diverse disciplines to explore the fundamental concepts of color theory and lighting. Typically housed within the College of Design, it is a vibrant part of the curriculum that attracts students studying art and design, architecture, photography, and even engineering.

The 'Color and Light' class begins with a foundational understanding of color—its science, perception, and cultural significance. Students learn about the color wheel, color relationships, and the impact of different lighting conditions on the perception of color. The course covers various aspects of color theory, including hue, saturation, and value, and extends into how these elements can be manipulated to achieve desired visual and emotional effects in design and art.

In this post, I will be showing the second half of the assignments that I created in the class. The first picture continues our exploration of value. We matched multiple colors from the color wheel with their corresponding values by pairing each with the appropriately darkened shade of gray. The next two assignments explore the concept that a color’s perceived value can change when it is surrounded by another color of a different value. For example, a neutral value color appears much lighter when surrounded by black. We first explored this concept using only shades of gray. In the following week, we applied this principle using actual colors and their values. I don't exactly remember what the next assignment was, but I believe it involved mixing a light and a dark value color together, with the gray representing the combined color’s value. The specifics of the next three assignments are unclear, but they involved applying what we had learned earlier in the semester.
