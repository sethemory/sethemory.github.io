In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as an Engineering Intern at Custom Controls Unlimited. I began by familiarizing myself with the company’s core tools, including VTScada and PLC programming using ladder logic. Though I wouldn’t focus heavily on PLC programming throughout the internship, it was exciting to learn how to build basic systems, like controls for a garage door and a timed streetlight system, during the tutorial phase.

My first major task was to redesign some pre-existing VTScada pages for better mobile compatibility. Many of the end-users were facility workers who accessed the system via their phones, but the original pages were designed for desktop use, making them cumbersome on smaller screens. This task was more than just a project for the intern—it had real potential to be implemented as a new feature for clients if my designs worked well and were well-received by customers. The experience allowed me to demonstrate some of the skills I was learning and contribute meaningfully to the company.

Later, I collaborated with one of the engineers on a larger project for a water management company. The company was overhauling its entire system, and we were tasked with recreating their control system from outdated software into VTScada. Over the last month of my internship, I focused on recreating pages and tag systems, learning a great deal about how complex control systems are built and maintained.
