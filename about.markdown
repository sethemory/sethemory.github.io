<h3>Welcome! I'm Seth Emory.</h3>

At 24, after graduating from North Carolina State University with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Art and Design, I find myself at the exciting intersection of technology and creativity. My journey has always been fueled by a dual passion for tech innovations and artistic expression, which I explored deeply during my time at university.

As a key member of our TEDx group, I spearheaded web development initiatives that not only enhanced our online presence but also deeply involved me in strategic marketing decisions. My coursework, classes like Human Computer Interaction and Web Applications, has equipped me with a robust toolkit that I’m eager to apply in a Front-End development role—my ultimate career goal.

<h3>Why This Site?</h3>

This platform is my digital canvas, where I showcase projects ranging from my senior design project to intriguing hobbies like laser wood engraving—an art I mastered during my academic adventures. Here, you'll find insights into the various roles I've embraced, the projects that have challenged me, and the diverse interests I've cultivated.

Feel free to explore my portfolio, delve into the specifics of my projects, and reach out if you're interested in discussing potential collaborations or just exchanging ideas!
