### 4. **Testing the Layout**

- **Render and Review**: Generate your site and navigate to one of the project pages to see how the new layout handles the mixed content.
- **Responsive Check**: Resize your browser or use device emulation to ensure the page looks good on all device sizes.
- **Content Flexibility**: Add several types of content to your Markdown files to test the layout's capability to handle complex and varied data types.

This setup will allow you to seamlessly integrate text, images with captions, and code snippets within your project pages, directly through Markdown, providing maximum flexibility and ease of content management.
